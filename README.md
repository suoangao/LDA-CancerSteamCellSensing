# LDA-CancerSteamCellSensing
To solve the problem of tediously and repeatedly analyzing large-scale dataset, I developed a computational strategy that can quickly and automatically implement LDA on cell sensing data. To do so, I trained the algorithm with primary data generated from a chemistry research laboratory at UMass. I further used Jackknifed classification to validate the predictability

Remember, this is just a fast test for the lab enviroment. This is not a practical way to test living sample.
Also please be aware of the data input format
